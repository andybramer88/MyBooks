MyBooks
=======

This app is useful to keep your favorite books organized.
You can add, change and delete your favorite books. 
To find your books very quick, a filter and as-/descending function is also implementet.
If you add new books or change the information of a book, there will be a check if the input is valid.

valid ISBN for testing purposes: 9781861972712
invalid ISBN: 9781861972711

There are 2 special things regarding the app:
1) If you try to search something, and you want to view all books again, the field has to be emptied and you have to search again.
2) If you are type in very long titles or athors (with line break), it can occure that the dropdown arrow is not visible, but it works also fine.
This is a bug regarding GUI.
